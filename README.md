Emys is a dynamic searchable symmetric encryption scheme for approximate string
search. A formal spec is currently not available.

This implementation is in progress and should not be considered stable. It's
not yet a good time to contribute. The initial work derives from my master's
thesis.

Reach out to me if you'd like to discuss the spec or other related topics.
